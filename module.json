  "description": "Shows narrative health descriptors when hovering over enemy tokens. Instead of seeing exact HP numbers, players see states like Unhurt, Injured, or Near Death in colored tooltips. Inspired by classic CRPGs like Baldur's Gate and Planescape: Torment. GMs retain full numeric HP visibility.",
